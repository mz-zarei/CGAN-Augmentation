# Abstract
In this paper, we present a crash frequency data augmentation method using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks which can improve crash frequency models (i.e. safety performance functions or SPF). The proposed method is evaluated by comparing the performance of Base-SPF (SPFs developed using original data) and Augmented-SPF (SPFs developed using original data plus synthesized data) in terms of hotspot identification performance (i.e. False Identification (FI) and Poisson Mean Difference (PMD) tests), model prediction accuracy, dispersion parameter estimation accuracy, and cumulative residual plots. The experiments are conducted using simulated and real-world crash data sets. The results from real data experiments indicate that in most cases the synthesized crash data by CGAN have the statistically similar distribution as the original data, and the crash frequency prediction accuracy for the test data set has improved by about 20% when using Augmented-SPFs. In addition, the simulation results show that, the Augmented-SPF can improve Base-SPF in terms of FI (up to 3%), PMD (up to 6%), MAPE of empirical Bayes estimates (up to 5%), and MAPE of dispersion parameter estimation (up to 36%).
